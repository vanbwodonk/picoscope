# Rule for Pico Technology USB Oscilloscopes and Dataloggers
#
# Copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.d to install it.
# Udev rules files should normally belong to root:root and
# have permissions 0644. They are parsed in alphabetical
# order when a device is connected (with rules parsed later
# taking priority over those relating to the same device 
# which have been parsed earlier). With the default
# filename, 95-pico.rules, the device-file ownership and
# permission rules in this file will have priority over most
# others that may already be installed. If you are sure that 
# this is not what you want, you can simply rename the file
# (for example, to 05-pico.rules to give it near-minimum
# priority).
#
# On older systems you may need to use udevcontrol
# to cause udev to reread the rules files as follows if you want
# the rule to take immediate effect without restarting udev:
#
# udevcontrol reload_rules
#
# This isn't needed on newer systems (rules files are reread 
# automatically) but it won't do any harm either.
#
# The rule below matches USB devices with Pico Technology's VID: 0CE9.
# It changes the group of the newly-created device node to "pico" and 
# sets the file permissions to 660 (RW for the owner and group). Note
# that the two idVendor parts (with SYSFS and ATTRS) are used by older
# and newer udev systems to retrieve the same information: the one
# that is not applicable will simply be ignored.
#
# To use this you should create a group called "pico" and add any users 
# who need to access the pico devices to it. On a typical system you can 
# achieve this by executing the following commands as root:
# * To create the group:
#
#      addgroup pico
#
# * To add a user called bob to the group
#
#      usermod -a -G pico bob
#
# (the -a specifies that bob should be added to the pico group
#  in addition to any groups of which he is currently a member)
#
# You will probably need to logout and login for the changes to take effect
